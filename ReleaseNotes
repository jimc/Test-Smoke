=item 0

This release is two years overdue.

=item 1

C<Test::Smoke::SysInfo> is a work in progress. Some more tweaking for
Solaris was done with the help of Alan Burlison and Davis Woolger.

=item 2

I order to support systems without C<rsync(1)> access, I have added
C<Test::Smoke::FTPClient> that syncs source-trees with Net::FTP from
the ActiveState ftp repository. It is slow, but gets the job done.

=item 3

A lot of filename/directoryname issues with VMS were resolved.

=item 4

A new way to get test results directly from "make test_harness" was
introduced to help VMS (and perhaps Win32).

=item 5

Jarkko Hietaniemi supplied a way to add C compiler messages to the
smoke report.

=item 6

Patches applied through the pfile mechanism now support a third
argument that represents a patch description. This (optional)
description is also added to F<patchlevel.h>.

Added a new "Locally applied patches:" section to the smoke report.

=item 7

The longtime TODO item of patching with forest setup has been
resolved. For this type of setup, first the intermediate tree is
patched and then the build tree is resynced from that.

=item 8

I added an option to indicate that tests should only be run once and
by harness (I<harnessonly>).

=item 9

The I<defaultenv> option is now on by default for MSWin32.

=item 10

In a UTF-8 environment ($LANG) a charset=UTF8 header will be added to the
e-mail when possible.
